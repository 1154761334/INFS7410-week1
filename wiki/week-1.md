# Week 1: Introduction & Architecture of a Search Engine


##  Introduction
 This course will teach design, engineer and develop software to help users **find** information which will deal with:
 
* in unstructured data
* in large scale repository
* with underspecified, poor queries
* efficiently, effectively (thus evaluate)

In this courese we will learn some technology to create a basic systern

## Week 1 Outline:

### [Information Retrieval (IR)](source/week-1/Information\ Retrieval\ \(IR\).md)

Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds.


### [Search Engines](source/week-1/Type\ of\ Search\ Engines.md)

A search engine is a complex software system that is designed to carry out search  which means to search the information in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. 

### [Standard process of IR](source/week-1/Documents and Collections.md)
In more detail the standard process of IR can be described as the folloing sequence of steps:

1. Start with an information need,user input a **Query**
1. Select a **Verticals** which is different search engines
1. Send the **query** to the system
1. Receive the **result** which contains:

	
		Document: (semi-) instructed information
		
		Ranking: results are ordered by some criteria
		
		SERP: search engine result page - the whole page of results
1. **Scan** ,**evaluate**,and **interpret** the **result**
1. **Stop**
