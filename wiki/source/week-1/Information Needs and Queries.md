### Types of query languages
1. Full-text.

Only tokens are defined in the CFG. Web search engines often use this approach.
1. Boolean. A query language that also supports the use of the Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT.
1. Structured. A language that supports searching within (a combination of) fields when a document is structured and has been indexed using its document structure.
1. Natural language. A query language that supports natural language by parsing the natural language query to a form that can be best used to retrieve relevant documents, for example with Question Answering systems or conversational search.
