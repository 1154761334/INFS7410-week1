# Architecture of a Search Engine

##Search
The process of Search as below:

Stage 1: Initiation
During the first stage, initiation, the information seeker recognizes the need for new information to complete an assignment.
Stage 2: Selection
In the second stage, selection, the individual begins to decide what topic will be investigated and how to proceed.

Stage 3: Exploration
In the third stage, exploration, information on the topic is gathered and a new personal knowledge is created.

Stage 4: Formulation
During the fourth stage, formulation, the information seeker starts to evaluate the information that has been gathered. At this point, a focused perspective begins to form and there is not as much confusion and uncertainty as in earlier stages.

Stage 5: Collection
During the fifth stage, collection, the information seeker knows what is needed to support the focus. Now presented with a clearly focused, personalized topic, the information seeker will experience greater interest, increased confidence, and more successful searching.

Stage 6: Search closure
In the sixth and final stage, search closure, the individual has completed the information search. Now the information seeker will summarize and report on the information that was found through the process. 

The total process as figure below:

##Indexing
Indexing is the act of describing or classifying a document by index terms or other symbols in order to indicate what the document is about, to summarize its content or to increase its findability. In other words, it is about identifying and describing the subject of documents. Indexes are constructed, separately, on three distinct levels: terms in a document such as a book; objects in a collection such as a library; and documents (such as books and articles) within a field of knowledge.
The process of indexing as below:

##Querying process

The Querying step is for search engines to understand what kind of information the user is looking for.

To do that, they analyze the userâ€™s query (search terms) by breaking it down into a number of meaningful keywords.

A keyword is a word that has a specific meaning and purpose.

The total process of querying process as show in below:
