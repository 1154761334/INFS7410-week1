# Information Retrieval (IR)

Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds.

## Importance of IF of Information Retrieval techniques

* Information Retrieval techniques are widespread in areas like Data Science, even outside of search
* Search is core to many Information Systems applications
* Developers currently deploying Search Engines have no underthe-bonnet knowledge

At the end of this course we will :


1. 	Gain in-depth knowledge of the core principles in the information retrieval field such as text representation and similarity computation, indexing textual documents, query correction and expansion, retrieval models, performance evaluation and metrics
1. 	Acquire hands-on practical experience with the development of components of Web search engines and experimentation of end-to-end systems using relevant open-source libraries.
1. 	Understand advanced topics in information retrieval research such as learning to rank, neural retrieval and ranking, A/B testing
1. 	Create, analyse and evaluate novel information retrieval solutions to search related problems
1. 	Compare and contrast information retrieval methods and communicate their differences, advantages and disadvantages, based on quantitative evaluation.
1. 	Analyse search tasks and problems, and identify and communicate relevant information retrieval solutions.
